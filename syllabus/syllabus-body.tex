\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

From the CofC catalog:

\begin{quote}
An introductory course for majors and non-majors that emphasizes the
analysis of current domestic and international issues. Issues covered
will vary from semester to semester.
\end{quote}

\noindent For this course we will be examining the issue of
\textbf{climate change}. Specifically, we will use the issue of climate
change to examine the process of addressing complex problems in the
United States (and globally to a lesser extent), explore how science
impacts policymaking, and examine why the United States has been unable,
at the federal level, to development policy approaches to address
climate change.

\hypertarget{political-science-learning-outcomes}{%
\subsubsection{Political Science Learning
Outcomes}\label{political-science-learning-outcomes}}

After taking this course:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Students will become familiar with a number of contemporary political
  issues and better understand their make‚Äêup and importance
\item
  Students will understand how different political issues are assessed
  by different philosophical and ideological traditions
\item
  Students will be able to effectively write and develop arguments
\item
  Students will be able to better comprehend other's views and
  formulate, defend their own positions
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{general-social-science-education-learning-outcomes}{%
\subsubsection{General Social Science Education Learning
Outcomes}\label{general-social-science-education-learning-outcomes}}

Upon completion of this course students should be able to apply social
science concepts, models or theories to explain human behavior, social
interactions or social institutions. This will be assessed in the final
exam.

\hypertarget{delivery-format}{%
\subsection{Delivery Format}\label{delivery-format}}

This is an asynchronous online course, and so it is largely self-paced.
Students must have access to a \textbf{computer} with \textbf{high-speed
internet access} throughout the course. In addition, students must have
access to \textbf{OAKS} and \emph{should check OAKS frequently (AT LEAST
every other day) to be sure not to fall behind}. Finally, students must
have access to their \textbf{CofC email}. \textbf{Computer
failure/unavailability does not constitute an excuse for not completing
assignments by the due date}.

\vspace{0.1in}

\noindent It is essential that students stay on top of the course
assignments. I will post due dates, but it is your responsibility to
make sure you don't get behind, especially in a class this short. Do not
make the mistake of thinking this is an easy class because we're meeting
online, or an easy class because it's meeting over the summer. The
material is quite difficult, and will take a lot of effort on your part
to master. \emph{A Summer I class that meets face-to-face normally
entails three hours of classroom time per weekday, plus reading and
homework each night. The workload for this class will be the same,
except our classroom will be OAKS}.

an email or discussion board that you would not make in person. Be
respectful of your classmates. In this course we are addressing an issue
that is politically controversial. All discussions will be respectful to
differing views. However, this course will be about learning to approach
policy issues as scholars and analysts, not as partisans for one
particular point of view.}

development of policies to address climate change. Specifically, this
module will examine the question, \emph{given the strong scientific
consensus about climate change, why don't we agree and why don't we
act}?
