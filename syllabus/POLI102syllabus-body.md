# Course Description 

From the CofC catalog: 

> An introductory course for majors and non-majors that emphasizes the analysis of current domestic and international issues. Issues covered will vary from semester to semester. 

\noindent For this course we will be examining the issue of **climate change**. Specifically, we will use the issue of climate change to examine the process of addressing complex problems in the United States (and globally to a lesser extent), explore how science impacts policymaking, and examine why the United States has been unable, at the federal level, to development policy approaches to address climate change.  

## Course Goals and Learning Objectives

### Political Science Learning Outcomes 

After taking this course: 

* Students will become familiar with a number of contemporary political issues and better understand their make‐up and importance

* Students will understand how different political issues are assessed by different philosophical and ideological traditions

* Students will be able to effectively write and develop arguments

* Students will be able to better comprehend other’s views and formulate, defend their own positions

### General Social Science Education Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course students should be able to apply social science concepts, models or theories to explain human behavior, social interactions or social institutions. This will be assessed in the final exam. 

## Delivery Format

This is an asynchronous online course, and so it is largely self-paced. Students must have access to a __computer__ with __high-speed internet access__ throughout the course. In addition, students must have access to __OAKS__ and _should check OAKS frequently (AT LEAST every other day) to be sure not to fall behind_. Finally, students must have access to their __CofC email__. __Computer failure/unavailability does not constitute an excuse for not completing assignments by the due date__.

\noindent It is essential that students stay on top of the course assignments. I will post due dates, but it is your responsibility to make sure you don't get behind, especially in a class this short. Do not make the mistake of thinking this is an easy class because we're meeting online, or an easy class because it's meeting over the summer. The material is quite difficult, and will take a lot of effort on your part to master. _A Summer I class that meets face-to-face normally entails three hours of classroom time per weekday, plus reading and homework each night. The workload for this class will be the same, except our classroom will be OAKS_.
