# Climate Change 

_A long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earthâ€™s local, regional, and global climates. These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the term_ 

--

* "Long-term" = 30 years 
* Climate vs. weather 
* Climate change vs. global warming

# Climate Science 

**Contrary (false) claims** 

--

**_Claim 1: Global warming has stopped / is not occurring_** 

--

**_Claim 2: Climate has always changed, so future climate change is nothing to worry about_**

--

**_Claim 3: Climate models predict too much warming; future warming will be much less than predicted_**
