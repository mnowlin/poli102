# Policy 

**Actions by governments to address problems or issues of social concern** 

The policymaking process involves a complex mix of institutions that share policymaking authority 
* Congress: makes legislation 
* Executive: rules and regulations; executive orders 
* Courts: review actions of other branches; issue rulings 

**The science and policies associated with climate change is highly politicized**

# Addressing Climate Change 

**How bad will it be? _Depends on what we do_** 

--

**Two (maybe three) broad approaches** 
* Adaptation 
* Mitigation
* _Geoengineering_?

--

**Need all of the above**

class: title title-1

# Adaptation 

**Targets the effects of climate change** 

--

Species adapt to climate conditions, _but current changes are too large and too fast_  

--

**Policy approaches to enhance adaptation**  
* Provide information: e.g., climate projections, impact studies 
* Regulatory: e.g., zoning
* Direct capacity: e.g., infrastructure (like sea walls)

# Mitigation 

**Targets the causes of climate change** 

--

_Emissions_ = _Population_ **X** _Economic output_ **X** _Technology_ (energy produced and energy consumed)
